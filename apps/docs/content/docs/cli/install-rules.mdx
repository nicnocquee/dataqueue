| `react-dashboard.md` | React SDK and Dashboard components                            |

## Install Locations

| Client         | Installs To                                                                                                                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cursor         | `.cursor/rules/dataqueue-basic.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/dataqueue-advanced.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/dataqueue-react-dashboard.mdc` |
| Claude Code    | `CLAUDE.md` (appended between markers)                                                                                     |
| AGENTS.md      | `AGENTS.md` (appended between markers)                                                                                     |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (appended between markers)                                                               |
| Windsurf       | `CONVENTIONS.md` (appended between markers)                                                                                |

<Callout>
  For Cursor, each rule file is written separately. For all other clients, the
  rules are combined and appended to a single file between `&lt;!-- DATAQUEUE
  RULES START --&gt;` and `&lt;!-- DATAQUEUE RULES END --&gt;` markers.
  Re-running the command updates the content between the markers without
  duplicating it.
