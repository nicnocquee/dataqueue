In this docs, we'll use a Next.js with App Router project which is deployed to Vercel as an example.

## Next.js Shortcut

If you're using Next.js, you can scaffold everything — API routes, a job queue singleton, a cron script, and all dependencies — with a single command:

```bash
npx dataqueue-cli init
```

The command auto-detects your project structure (App Router vs Pages Router, `src/` directory vs root) and creates all the files you need. See the [`init` CLI reference](/cli/init) for full details.

If you prefer to set things up manually, follow the steps below.

## PostgreSQL Backend

1. [Run migrations before deploying your app](/usage/database-migration)
2. [Define job handlers](/usage/job-handlers)
3. [Initialize the job queue](/usage/init-queue)
4. [Add a job](/usage/add-job)
5. Create three API routes to [process jobs](/usage/process-jobs), [reclaim stuck jobs](/usage/reclaim-jobs), and [cleanup old jobs](/usage/cleanup-jobs)
6. [Call those API routes periodically](/usage/process-jobs#triggering-the-processor-via-cron) via a cron service (like Vercel cron) or a small script like [this one](https://github.com/nicnocquee/dataqueue/blob/main/apps/demo/cron.sh) during development.

## Redis Backend

1. [Install `ioredis`](/intro/install)
2. [Define job handlers](/usage/job-handlers)
3. [Initialize the job queue with Redis config](/usage/init-queue#redis)
4. [Add a job](/usage/add-job)
5. Create three API routes to [process jobs](/usage/process-jobs), [reclaim stuck jobs](/usage/reclaim-jobs), and [cleanup old jobs](/usage/cleanup-jobs)
6. [Call those API routes periodically](/usage/process-jobs#triggering-the-processor-via-cron) via a cron service (like Vercel cron) or a small script like [this one](https://github.com/nicnocquee/dataqueue/blob/main/apps/demo/cron.sh) during development.

<Callout>
  The Redis backend requires **no database migrations**. Just install `ioredis`,
  configure the connection, and you're ready to go.

## Long-Running Server

If you're running a persistent server (Express, Fastify, plain Node.js, etc.) instead of a serverless environment, the setup is slightly different:

1. [Run migrations](/usage/database-migration) (PostgreSQL) or [install `ioredis`](/intro/install) (Redis)
2. [Define job handlers](/usage/job-handlers)
3. [Initialize the job queue](/usage/init-queue)
4. Start the processor in the background with `startInBackground()`
5. Start the [background supervisor](/usage/long-running-server#background-supervisor) with `createSupervisor()` to automate maintenance (reclaim stuck jobs, cleanup old data)
6. Handle `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` for graceful shutdown with `stopAndDrain()`

See [Long-Running Server](/usage/long-running-server) for a complete walkthrough and full example.
