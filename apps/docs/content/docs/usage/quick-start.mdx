In this docs, we'll use a Next.js with App Router project which is deployed to Vercel as an example.

## PostgreSQL Backend

1. [Run migrations before deploying your app](/usage/database-migration)
2. [Define job handlers](/usage/job-handlers)
3. [Initialize the job queue](/usage/init-queue)
4. [Add a job](/usage/add-job)
5. Create three API routes to [process jobs](/usage/process-jobs), [reclaim stuck jobs](/usage/reclaim-jobs), and [cleanup old jobs](/usage/cleanup-jobs)
6. Call those API routes periodically.

## Redis Backend

1. [Install `ioredis`](/intro/install)
2. [Define job handlers](/usage/job-handlers)
3. [Initialize the job queue with Redis config](/usage/init-queue#redis)
4. [Add a job](/usage/add-job)
5. Create three API routes to [process jobs](/usage/process-jobs), [reclaim stuck jobs](/usage/reclaim-jobs), and [cleanup old jobs](/usage/cleanup-jobs)
6. Call those API routes periodically.

<Callout>
  The Redis backend requires **no database migrations**. Just install `ioredis`,
  configure the connection, and you're ready to go.
