title: Add Job
---

You can add jobs to the queue from your application logic, such as in a [server function](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-functions):

```typescript title="@/app/actions/send-email.ts"
'use server';

import { getJobQueue } from '@/lib/queue';
import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache';

export const sendEmail = async ({
  name,
  email,
}: {
  name: string;
  email: string;
}) => {
  // Add a welcome email job
  const jobQueue = getJobQueue(); // [!code highlight]
  try {
    const runAt = new Date(Date.now() + 5 * 1000); // Run 5 seconds from now
    // [!code highlight:10]
    const job = await jobQueue.addJob({
      jobType: 'send_email',
      payload: {
        to: email,
        subject: 'Welcome to our platform!',
        body: `Hi ${name}, welcome to our platform!`,
      },
      priority: 10, // Higher number = higher priority
      runAt: runAt,
      tags: ['welcome', 'user'], // Add tags for grouping/searching
    });

    revalidatePath('/');
    return { job };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error adding job:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

In the example above, a job is added to the queue to send an email. The job type is `send_email`, and the payload includes the recipient's email, subject, and body.

When adding a job, you can set its `priority`, schedule when it should run using `runAt`, and specify a timeout in milliseconds with `timeoutMs`.

You can also add `tags` (an array of strings) to group, search, or batch jobs by category. See [Tags](/api/tags) for more details.

## Idempotency

You can provide an `idempotencyKey` when adding a job to prevent duplicate jobs. If a job with the same key already exists in the queue, `addJob` returns the existing job's ID instead of creating a new one.

This is useful for preventing duplicates caused by retries, double-clicks, webhook replays, or serverless function re-invocations.

```typescript title="@/app/actions/send-welcome.ts"
'use server';

import { getJobQueue } from '@/lib/queue';

export const sendWelcomeEmail = async (userId: string, email: string) => {
  const jobQueue = getJobQueue();
  // [!code highlight:8]
  const jobId = await jobQueue.addJob({
    jobType: 'send_email',
    payload: {
      to: email,
      subject: 'Welcome!',
      body: `Welcome to our platform!`,
    },
    idempotencyKey: `welcome-email-${userId}`, // prevents duplicate welcome emails
  });

  return { jobId };
};
```

In the example above, calling `sendWelcomeEmail` multiple times for the same `userId` will only create one job. Subsequent calls return the existing job's ID.

### Behavior

- **No key provided**: Works exactly as before, no uniqueness check is performed.
- **Key provided, no conflict**: The job is inserted and its new ID is returned.
- **Key provided, conflict**: The existing job's ID is returned. The existing job is **not** updated.
- **Scope**: The key is unique across the entire `job_queue` table regardless of job status. Once a key exists, it cannot be reused until the job is cleaned up via [`cleanupOldJobs`](/usage/cleanup-jobs).
