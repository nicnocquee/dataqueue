To get a job by its ID:

```typescript
const job = await jobQueue.getJob(pool, jobId);
```

To get all jobs:

```typescript
const jobs = await jobQueue.getAllJobs(pool, limit, offset);
```

To get jobs by status:

```typescript
const jobs = await jobQueue.getJobsByStatus(pool, status, limit, offset);
```

## Get Jobs by Tags

You can get jobs by their tags using the `getJobsByTags` method:

```typescript
const jobs = await jobQueue.getJobsByTags(['welcome', 'user'], 'all', 10, 0);
```

- The first argument is an array of tags to match.
- The second argument is the tag query mode. See [Tags](/api/tags) for more details.
- The third and fourth arguments are optional for pagination.
