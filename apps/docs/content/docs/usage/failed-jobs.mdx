title: Failed Jobs
---

A job handler can fail for many reasons, such as a bug in the code or running out of resources.

When a job fails, it will be retried up to `max_attempts` times. If it still fails after all attempts, its status will be set to `failed`. You can set the `max_attempts` value when adding the job to the queue.

Each retry is scheduled after `2^attempts * 1 minute` from the previous attempt. You can view the error history for a job in its `error_history` field.
