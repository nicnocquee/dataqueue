title: Database Migration
---

After installing the package, add the following script to your `package.json` to apply [the migrations](https://github.com/nicnocquee/dataqueue/tree/main/packages/dataqueue/migrations):

```json title="package.json"
"scripts": {
  "migrate-dataqueue": "dataqueue-cli migrate"
}
```

Next, run this command to apply the migrations:

```package-install
npm run migrate-dataqueue
```

This will apply all the necessary schema migrations so your Postgres database is ready to use with DataQueue.

<Callout type="warn">
  **Make sure the `PG_DATAQUEUE_DATABASE` environment variable is set to your
  Postgres connection string.** The CLI uses this environment variable to
  connect to your database.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
  **You must run these migrations before using the job queue.** For example, if
  you are deploying your app to Vercel, run this command before deploying in the
  Vercel's pipeline. If you have used Prisma or other ORMs, you may be familiar
  with this process.

### Running migrations with SSL (Managed Postgres)

Most managed Postgres providers (like DigitalOcean, Supabase, etc.) require SSL connections using a CA certificate (`.crt` file). You typically only need to provide the CA cert, but if your provider requires client authentication, you can also provide a client certificate and key.

Set the following environment variables before running the migration:

```bash
PGSSLMODE=require \
PGSSLROOTCERT=/absolute/path/to/ca.crt \
PG_DATAQUEUE_DATABASE=your_connection_string \
npm run migrate-dataqueue
```

- `PGSSLMODE=require` enforces SSL.
- `PGSSLROOTCERT` should point to your provider's CA `.crt` file.
- If your provider requires client authentication, you can also set:
  - `PGSSLCERT=/absolute/path/to/client.crt`
  - `PGSSLKEY=/absolute/path/to/client.key`

You can also add these variables to your `.env` file:

```
PGSSLMODE=require
PGSSLROOTCERT=/absolute/path/to/ca.crt
PG_DATAQUEUE_DATABASE=your_connection_string
```

### Using a custom .env file

You can use the `--envPath` option to specify a custom path to your environment file. For example:

```package-install
npm run migrate-dataqueue -- --envPath .env.local
```

This will load environment variables from `.env.local` before running the migration.

### Schema selection

You can explicitly set the schema for migrations using the `-s` or `--schema` CLI option. This option is passed directly to `node-pg-migrate` and will ensure the schema is created if it does not exist.

**Example CLI usage with explicit schema:**

```package-install
npm run migrate-dataqueue -- --envPath .env.local --schema dataqueue
```

<Callout>
  Specifying the schema is optional but **recommended**. If you don't specify
  the schema, the CLI will use the default schema which is `public`. If you use
  [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io), the prisma migration will fail because of the
  additional tables added by DataQueue.
