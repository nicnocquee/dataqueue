title: Reclaim Jobs

<Callout>
  Running a long-lived server? Use
  [`createSupervisor()`](/usage/long-running-server#background-supervisor) to
  automate stuck-job reclaiming instead of calling `reclaimStuckJobs` manually.
</Callout>

Sometimes, a job can get stuck in the `processing` state. This usually happens if the process is killed or an unhandled error occurs after the job status is updated, but before it is marked as `completed` or `failed`.

To recover stuck jobs, use the `reclaimStuckJobs` method. The example below shows how to create an API route (`/api/cron/reclaim`) that can be triggered by a cron job:

```typescript title="@/app/api/cron/reclaim.ts"
import { getJobQueue } from '@/lib/queue';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  // Secure the cron route: https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs/manage-cron-jobs#securing-cron-jobs
  const authHeader = request.headers.get('authorization');
  if (authHeader !== `Bearer ${process.env.CRON_SECRET}`) {
    return NextResponse.json({ message: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
  }

  try {
    // [!code highlight:5]
    const jobQueue = getJobQueue();

    // Reclaim jobs stuck for more than 10 minutes
    const reclaimed = await jobQueue.reclaimStuckJobs(10);
    console.log(`Reclaimed ${reclaimed} stuck jobs`);

    return NextResponse.json({
      message: 'Stuck jobs reclaimed',
      reclaimed,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error reclaiming jobs:', error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { message: 'Failed to reclaim jobs' },
      { status: 500 },
    );
  }
}
```

#### Per-Job Timeout Awareness

`reclaimStuckJobs` respects each job's individual `timeoutMs`. If a job has a `timeoutMs` that is longer than `maxProcessingTimeMinutes`, it will not be reclaimed until its own timeout has elapsed. For example, if you call `reclaimStuckJobs(10)` and a job has `timeoutMs: 1800000` (30 minutes), that job will only be reclaimed after 30 minutes — not 10.

Jobs without a `timeoutMs` continue to use the global `maxProcessingTimeMinutes` threshold as before.

#### Scheduling the Reclaim Job with Cron

Add the following to your `vercel.json` to call the cron route every 10 minutes:

```json title="vercel.json"
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/reclaim",
      "schedule": "*/10 * * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```
