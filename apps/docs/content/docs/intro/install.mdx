title: Installation
---

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and TypeScript installed in your environment.

## PostgreSQL Backend

If you're using PostgreSQL as your backend, you need a Postgres database. Install the required libraries:

```package-install
npm install @nicnocquee/dataqueue
npm install -D node-pg-migrate ts-node
```

You need to install <code>node-pg-migrate</code> and <code>ts-node</code> as development dependencies to run [database migrations](/usage/database-migration).

## Redis Backend

If you're using Redis as your backend, you need a Redis server (v6+). Install the required libraries:

```package-install
npm install @nicnocquee/dataqueue ioredis
```

<Callout>
  The `ioredis` package is an optional peer dependency. You only need to install
  it if you choose Redis as your backend. No database migrations are required
  for Redis.
</Callout>
