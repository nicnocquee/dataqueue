description: How DataQueue compares to BullMQ and Trigger.dev
---

Choosing a job queue depends on your stack, infrastructure preferences, and the features you need. Here is a side-by-side comparison of **DataQueue**, **BullMQ**, and **Trigger.dev**.

## Where DataQueue shines

- **Serverless-first** — designed from the ground up for Vercel, AWS Lambda, and other serverless platforms. No long-running process required.
- **Use your existing database** — back your queue with PostgreSQL or Redis. No additional infrastructure to provision or pay for.
- **Wait and token system** — pause jobs with `waitFor`, `waitUntil`, or token-based waits for human-in-the-loop workflows, all within a single handler function.
- **Type-safe PayloadMap** — a generic `PayloadMap` gives you compile-time validation of every job type and its payload, catching bugs before they reach production.
- **Built-in Next.js dashboard** — add a full admin UI to your Next.js app with a single route file. No separate service to deploy.
